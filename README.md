Libraries useful for Dafny programs

## Status

At the moment, we're just collecting generally useful Dafny code.

Once we have some amount of code which is used successfully by several projects, we might restructure this repo, informed by the concrete use cases.

So, please do use this library, give feedback, and contribute code, but also expect breaking changes.

## Contributions

Any contributions of generally useful code are welcome, just open a pull request!
All added code should be accompanied by some examples in the `examples` directory which illustrates how to use the code.

## Acknowledgements
