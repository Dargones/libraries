Libraries useful for Dafny programs

## Status

At the moment, we're just collecting generally useful Dafny code.

Once we have some amount of code which is used successfully by several projects, we might restructure this repo, informed by the concrete use cases.

So, please do use this library, give feedback, and contribute code, but also expect breaking changes.

## Contributions

Any contributions of generally useful code are welcome, just open a pull request!  Please follow the [library style guidelines](STYLE.md).  If the way to use your new code is not obvious, please add some examples in the `examples` directory to illustrate how to use the code.
